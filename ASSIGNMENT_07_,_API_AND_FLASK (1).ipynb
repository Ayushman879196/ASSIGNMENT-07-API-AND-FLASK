        " Q: What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: A RESTful API is an application programming interface (API) that uses HTTP requests and\n",
        " follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles. It allows communication between clients\n",
        " and servers using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "\n",
        " A: An API specification is a detailed description of how an API works, including its endpoints,\n",
        " request/response formats, authentication methods, and error handling. Examples include OpenAPI\n",
        " and Swagger specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It is popular for APIs because it is simple, flexible,\n",
        " and provides essential tools like routing, request handling, and extensions such as Flask-RESTful\n",
        " and Flask-SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Routing in Flask is the process of mapping a URL to a function. It allows different endpoints of an\n",
        " application to perform specific actions when accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: You create a simple Flask app by installing Flask and writing code: from flask import Flask app =\n",
        " Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def home(): return 'Hello, Flask!' if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        " app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Common methods include: - GET: Retrieve data - POST: Create new data - PUT: Update\n",
        " existing data - DELETE: Remove data - PATCH: Partially update data\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: The @app.route() decorator is used to bind a URL path to a function in Flask. When a user visits\n",
        " that URL, the function is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: GET is used to retrieve data from a server, while POST is used to send data to the server to\n",
        " create or modify resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: You can handle errors using Flask's errorhandler decorator: @app.errorhandler(404) def\n",
        " not_found(e): return {'error': 'Not Found'}, 404\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: You can use Flask-SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQL database by configuring the database URI\n",
        " in Flask and initializing SQLAlchemy.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Flask-SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) that simplifies database interactions\n",
        " in Flask. It allows developers to work with Python objects instead of SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Blueprints in Flask help organize an application into smaller, modular components. They make\n",
        " large applications easier to maintain and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: The request object contains data about the HTTP request, including method, headers, form data,\n",
        " and JSON body.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: You create endpoints using route decorators and return JSON responses. Example: from flask\n",
        " import jsonify @app.route('/api/data') def get_data(): return jsonify({'message': 'Hello API'})\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: jsonify() converts Python dictionaries to JSON responses with proper MIME type\n",
        " (application/json).\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: Explain Flask’s url_for() function.\n",
        "\n",
        " A: url_for() dynamically builds URLs for routes based on their function names. It helps avoid\n",
        " hardcoding URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Flask serves static files from the 'static' folder by default. You can access them via\n",
        " '/static/filename'.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: HTTP status codes indicate the result of a request. Examples: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400\n",
        " (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Server Error). They help clients understand responses.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: POST requests are handled using @app.route() with methods=['POST']. Example:\n",
        " @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST']) def submit(): data = request.json return jsonify(data)\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Ways to secure include: using HTTPS, authentication (JWT, OAuth), input validation, rate\n",
        " limiting, and preventing SQL injection.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Flask-RESTful simplifies building REST APIs by providing tools like Resource classes, request\n",
        " parsing, and automatic JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: The session object stores user-specific data across requests. Data is stored securely using\n",
        " cookies and Flask's secret key"

        "\n",
        " Q: How do you serve static files like images or CSS in Flask?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        " Q: How do you define different routes with different HTTP methods in Flask?\n",

        " handle_data(): if request.method == 'GET': return 'Data Retrieved' else: return 'Data Posted'\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you render HTML templates in Flask?\n",

        "\n",
        " Q: How can you generate URLs for routes in Flask using url_for?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: url_for() generates URLs dynamically: @app.route('/profile/') def profile(username): return\n",
        " f'Profile: {username}' url_for('profile', username='john')\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you handle forms in Flask?\n",

        "\n",
        " Q: How can you validate form data in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Form data can be validated manually with conditions or using libraries like WTForms for\n",
        " structured validation.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q: How do you manage sessions in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " A: Use Flask's session object: from flask import session @app.route('/login') def login():\n",
