        " Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REST\n",
        " (Representational State Transfer). It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)\n",
        " for communication and is stateless, meaning each request is independent.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: An API specification defines how an API should behave. It includes details such as endpoints,\n",
        " request/response formats, methods allowed, and authentication mechanisms. Examples include\n",
        " OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It is popular because it is simple, flexible, easy\n",
        " to learn, and allows developers to quickly build APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q4. What is routing in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Routing is the process of mapping URLs to specific functions in Flask. It determines what\n",
        " code runs when a specific endpoint is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Install Flask, create a Python file, import Flask, create an app instance, define routes, and run\n",
        " the app using app.run().\n",
        "\n",
        " Q6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: The main HTTP methods are GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data),\n",
        " DELETE (remove data), and PATCH (partial update).\n",
        "\n",
        " Q7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: It is used to bind a URL endpoint to a function. When the endpoint is accessed, the function\n",
        " executes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: GET is used to request data and does not modify resources, while POST is used to submit\n",
        " data to create or modify resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use Flask's errorhandler decorators (e.g., @app.errorhandler(404)) or return custom JSON\n",
        " responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: You can use libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy to connect and interact with databases in Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: It provides ORM (Object Relational Mapping) support, making it easier to interact with\n",
        " databases using Python classes instead of raw SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Blueprints allow modular structuring of Flask applications. They help organize code into\n",
        " components, making apps easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: The request object stores data about the incoming request such as form data, query\n",
        " parameters, headers, and JSON payload.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Define a route using @app.route(), specify the HTTP me\n",
        " thod, and return JSON responses\n",
        " using jsonify().\n",
        "\n",
        " Q15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: jsonify() converts Python dictionaries into JSON responses with the correct MIME type\n",
        " (application/json).\n",
        "\n",
        " Q16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: url_for() generates dynamic URLs for routes based on function names, helping avoid\n",
        " hardcoding of URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Flask serves static files from the 'static' directory. You can access them via the /static/ path.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: It provides a contract for API behavior, ensuring consistency and easy collaboration between\n",
        " frontend and backend developers.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: HTTP status codes indicate the result of an API request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500\n",
        " Internal Server Error). They improve API clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use request.form or request.json to extract data, process it, and return a response.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q21. How would you secure a Flask API\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use authentication (JWT, OAuth), HTTPS, input validation, and proper error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Flask-RESTful simplifies building REST APIs by providing tools for request parsing, resource\n",
        " routing, and response formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: The session object stores user-specific data across requests, such as login information, using\n",
        " secure cookies.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q24. How do you create a basic Flask application\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/') def home(): return 'Hello,\n",
        " Flask!' app.run()\n",
        "\n",
        " Q25. How do you serve static files like images or CSS in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Place files in the static folder and access them via /static/filename.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q26. How do you define different routes with different HTTP methods in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use @app.route('/path', methods=['GET','POST']).\n",
        "\n",
        " Q27. How do you render HTML templates in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use Flask's render_template() function with templates stored in the 'templates' folder.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q28. How can you generate URLs for routes in Flask using url_for\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use url_for('function_name') to dynamically generate URLs.\n",

        "\n",
        " Q30. How can you validate form data in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use WTForms or manual validation (checking required fields, data types, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        " Q31. How do you manage sessions in Flask\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans: Use the session object to store and retrieve user-specific data across requests.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q32. How do you redirect to a different route in Flask\n",

        " in the main app.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q35. How do you define a custom Jinja filter in Flask\n",
        "\n",
